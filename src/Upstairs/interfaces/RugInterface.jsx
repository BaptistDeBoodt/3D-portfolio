import React from 'react';

const RugInterface = () => {
    return (
        <div className='interface'>
            <h1>GUITARZ</h1>
            <p>
                With my very first react project, I wanted to display guitars because... i love guitars.
                The colours arent the greatest, but it was a start. By clicking the button you can see a video of the project.

};

export default RugInterface;
