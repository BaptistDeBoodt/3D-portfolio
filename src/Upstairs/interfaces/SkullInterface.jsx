            <p>
                In our second year of College we had to go on a schooltrip to Barcelona.
                They organize an event called OFFF Festival. We had to make a website with a model whe had to generate ourselves in blender and an animation and put it on a webpage. We had to link it with a speaker that inspired us.
            </p>
            <a href="https://offf-festival-red.vercel.app/" target="_blank"><button>GO</button></a>
        </div>
    );
};
